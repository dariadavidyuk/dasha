# software architect: who are they?

being a software architect is considered the highest paid profession amongst the computing fields, however, after researching what the job
consists of exactly i've become stumped. generally, a software architect is defined by someone who makes ' high level design choices and 
frames technical standards.' as someone with little to no insight into any computing fields, let alone the one that sits on the top of the
computing food chain, these words have little meaning in my mind. i was left with more querstions than answers. as every google search
goes, the first place to look is sources like wikipedia, which itself was asking people to contribute any infromation they might have on the
profession. that definitely signalled to me how little is known about software architects, and almost how hidden and elitist this field seemed.

most descriptions of the profession specified some concrete factors that in the least qualified someone to be a software architect. those included:
- knowing a unified modelling language (UML)
- knowing more than 1 coding language (java, javascript, python etc.)
- managing software development practices in a collaborative and agile fashion = having a deep familiarity with DevOps (DevOps:a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. it aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. ) ((this also does not explain much to me unfortunately))

unlike software engineers or developers who tend to focus more on technical depth, an architect would focus more on technical breadth. that measns giving up on knowing the ins and out of a certain technology. instead, they need to know about what a certain technology does. the software architect needs to be involved with
developers. there needs to be a balance on the architects contribution. they need to understand the developer's problems to aid them through improving architecture.
what i gathered from this information was that software architects are not necessarily 'architects', they are simply all knowing people who smooth out the process of softwares. they are omnificents among their technical communities and that is why they are considered the top of the food chain. 

some key traits of a software architect:
-problem solving
-focuses on the 'how'
-thinks holistically
-uses technology creatively
-makes decisions
-gathers research
-is both an evaluator and analyst
-technical expert
-orchestrator of knowledge

essentially, a software architect has to be both creative and academic, with a pinch of responsibilty and effeciency, be a good leader, yet not over throw the process, collaborative by nature, willful and fair. it's starting to sound that software architects simply come into exsistance rather than grow into one. it takes a very certain, very talented person to be one, which makes them in incredibly high demand by most tech companies. all descriptive acknowledgements about the job are very vague, or broad, meaning the only way someone could really come into the position of power would be by working their way up.the other way someone could acquire that type of position would be simply through networking. as the individual they look for to fill this position is collaborative and has outwardly qualities suitable for a leadership role, being sociable is essential, knowing how to manage relations. most importantly, to get hired as a software architect, you need the companies trust. if the person responsible for the orchestration of the software developers is trusted by its higher ups and subordinates, their genral direction will be respected, and would truly make them a software architect.
